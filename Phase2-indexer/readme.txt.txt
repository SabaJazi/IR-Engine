This project needs 4 files to run properly:
	1- The parser_output.txt file which was made from the previous project and should be located where the source code is located.
	2- The document files which should be located in a sub folder of the directory named 
	./IR-Documents/ that code is located.
	(wherever code is located, make a new folder and name it IR-Documents. 
	The documents, whtaever they are, should be located in this folder)
	3- The forward_index.txt which will be located in a sub folder named IR-FW.
	4- The inverted_index.txt which will be located in a sub folder named IR-INV.
All the blocks should be run one after each other. Although if the forward index and inverted index
 are made already, skip the "making forward and inverted index" block and run the "search function" and then
"searching interface".

To search a term, when you run the "searching interface", you can input the term and enter and after the enter,
you can see the id of word to find it in parser file, and the result from the inverted index in the form of 
docid:freq, docid:freq.....
